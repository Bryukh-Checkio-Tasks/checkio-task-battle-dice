    For this task, you'll be playing some board games. Or rather, you're going to be, but first you'd like to know more about the probabilities involved.
</p>
    
<p>
    Many board games fall under the category of "roll and move" games. In these games, you roll some dice and move that many spaces forward. In some games, you then move forward or backwards a number of spaces depending on which space you landed on. 
</p>

<p>
    You want to work out, given a description of the board and the dice used, what the expected number of moves would be to reach a target square. For this task, all the boards under consideration are circular and when moving off one end you simply continue from the other.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> 
    A number of dice to roll, <strong>N</strong>, the number of sides on each die, <strong>S</strong>, a target space, <strong>T</strong>, and a list, <strong>B</strong>, containing how many spaces to move (positive for forward, negative for backwards) after landing on that space. You always start from space 0 and the starting and ending squares will not require any further movement after landing on them. Any further movement will move you to a space that does not require further futher movement. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> 
    The expected number of moves needed to reach the target space starting from space 0, correct to 1 digit after the decimal place. If it takes 33 1/3 moves, you should return 33.3.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
checkio(1, 4, 3, [0, 0, 0, 0]) == 4.0   # On these first three, you have a 1/4 chance of reaching the target
checkio(1, 4, 1, [0, 0, 0, 0]) == 4.0   # on every roll, so on average it will take 4 rolls.
checkio(1, 4, 3, [0, -1, -2, 0]) == 4.0 
checkio(1, 4, 3, [0, 2, 1, 0]) == 1.3   # You have a 3/4 chance of reaching the exit and 1/4 chance of ending up where you started
checkio(1, 6, 1, [0] * 10) == 8.6
checkio(2, 6, 1, [0] * 10) == 10.2
