    For this task, you want to figure out what your probability of winning a game is, or part of a game at least. The game involves two players moving units around a map. When the units come into conflict, the two players roll several dice, one for each unit, to see who wins and at what cost. You want to find the probability of winning one of these conflicts, regardless of any losses. (If the conflict ends with no units remaining on either side, that's a draw, not a win.) 
</p>
    
<p>
    When a conflict begins, each player rolls one die per unit. Each die has a number of attack icons and defence icons on each side. After a roll, each player loses a number of units equal to the number of attack icons the opponent rolled minus the number of defence icons they rolled themselves. For example, if player one rolled 2 attack icons and 4 defence icons and player two rolled 3 attack icons and 1 defence icons, player one would lose 0 units (3 - 4 but you can't lose negative units) and player two would lose 1 unit (2 - 1).
</p>

<p>
    After unit losses are applied, the players roll again. This continues until one player has no units remaining.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a description of the dice as a list of what icons are on each face and how many dice each player has. (All dice are the same.) Each element of the list is a string containing zero or more A's representing the attack icons and zero of more D's representing the defence icons. (A face can be blank.) For example, the list ["AAD", "ADD", "A", "D", "", ""] represents a six sided die with two attack and one defence on one face, one attack and two defence on another, a single attack on the third face, a single defence on the fourth and two blank faces.

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> 
    A list of strings, <strong>D</strong>, describing the dice used; an integer, <strong>n1</strong>, representing the number of units player one has; and an integer, <strong>n2</strong>, representing the number of units player two has.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> 
    The probability that player one will win the conflict, correct to four decimal places. (A draw is not counted as a win.) If player one has a 1 in 7 chance of winning, you should return 0.1429.
